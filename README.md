Java Console Projects
Task-1: Student List CRUD (ArrayList)
Task-2: Music Playlist Manager (LinkedList)
This repository contains two Java console-based projects:
1..Student CRUD Management System (using ArrayList)
2..Music Playlist Manager (using LinkedList)
Both programs are simple, beginner-friendly, menu-driven console applications that demonstrate Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts and Java collection frameworks.
